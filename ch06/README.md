# Chapter 6: Finetuning for Classification

&nbsp;
## Main Chapter Code

- [01_main-chapter-code](01_main-chapter-code) contains the main chapter code

01_main-chapter-code

This is the core of Chapter 6. Here’s what you’ll find and how to use it:
ch06.ipynb

Purpose: The main notebook for the chapter.

Contents:
Step-by-step walkthroughs of fine-tuning a GPT-like model on a new dataset.
Code for data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation.
Model training loops with explanations of hyperparameters, optimization strategies, and regularization.
Evaluation sections using metrics like accuracy, perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, or custom metrics.
Visualization tools for loss curves, attention maps, or prediction samples.
Discussion cells explaining the rationale behind each step, common pitfalls, and best practices.

exercise-solutions.ipynb

Purpose: Contains solutions to the exercises posed in the main notebook.
How to use: Try the exercises yourself first, then consult this notebook to check your approach and learn alternative solutions.

previous_chapters.py

Purpose: Utility module with reusable code from earlier chapters.

Contents: Model definitions (e.g., GPTModel, MultiHeadAttention), tokenizer utilities, and helper functions for data processing or evaluation.

tests.py

Purpose: Automated tests to verify the correctness of your code and model.

How to use: Run this script after making changes to ensure your implementation is robust and bug-free.

README.md
Purpose: Local documentation for the 01_main-chapter-code folder, summarizing the notebook’s objectives, prerequisites, and usage instructions.
Other Folders
02_performance-analysis/
Purpose: Contains scripts and notebooks for benchmarking model speed, memory usage, and scalability. Useful for understanding bottlenecks and optimizing your training pipeline.
03_user_interface/
Purpose: Provides code for building interactive user interfaces (e.g., web apps, chatbots) to interact with your fine-tuned LLM. May use frameworks like Streamlit, Gradio, or Chainlit.
Other Bonus or Extension Folders
Purpose: Explore advanced topics such as distributed training, model quantization, or integration with external APIs. May include real-world case studies or research experiments.
How to Use This Chapter
Start with 01_main-chapter-code/ch06.ipynb:
Read the markdown explanations and run the code cells sequentially.
Experiment with different datasets or hyperparameters as suggested.
Attempt the exercises:
Strengthen your understanding by solving the embedded exercises.
Use exercise-solutions.ipynb to check your work.
Leverage utility code:
Import functions from previous_chapters.py to avoid rewriting boilerplate.
Validate your work:
Run tests.py to ensure your code and models are functioning as expected.
Explore additional folders:
Dive into performance analysis, user interface demos, or bonus topics as your interest and needs dictate.
Tips
Each subfolder may include its own README with more specific instructions.
If you encounter issues, check the test scripts and review the markdown explanations in the notebooks.
For advanced users, try extending the code to new datasets, tasks, or model architectures.
