# Chapter 5: Pretraining on Unlabeled Data

This chapter focuses on the pretraining phase of large language models (LLMs) like GPT, using unlabeled text data. It covers the full workflow from implementing a training loop, evaluating generative models, loading and saving model weights, and exploring advanced training and deployment techniques. The chapter is organized into a main code section and a rich set of bonus and extension folders.

## Main Chapter Code

- **[01_main-chapter-code](01_main-chapter-code):**  
  Contains the main Jupyter notebook (`ch05.ipynb`) that walks through the chapter's core content:
  - Implements the training loop for pretraining a GPT model from scratch.
  - Introduces evaluation metrics for generative models (cross-entropy, perplexity).
  - Demonstrates how to load and use pretrained weights from OpenAI.
  - Includes scripts for downloading weights (`gpt_download.py`), training (`gpt_train.py`), and text generation (`gpt_generate.py`).
